## Test data for IP4GS
### Genomic data
* MZ_1404_4903.hmp.txt: 1,404 hybrid lines with 4,903 SNPs in HapMap format.
* MZ_sub_test.hmp.txt: 100 hybrid lines with 300 SNPs in HapMap format for IP4GS fast test (Remark: it is a portion of file MZ_1404_4903).

### Phenotypic data
* MZ_phe.txt: Phenotypic data of 1,404 hybrid lines, involves three trait, FT for flower time (days to tasseling), PH for plant height and GY for grain yield (ear weight).
* MZ_test_phe.txt: Phenotypic data of 100 hybrid lines, corresponding to MZ_sub_test.hmp.txt (Remark: it is a portion of file MZ_1404_4903)
